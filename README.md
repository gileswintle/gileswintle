Hi,

I work in the internaitonal real estate fund management industry, basied in France.

I use code for optimisation, visualization and analysis of risk and return. Sorry - most of my repositories are private because of the nature of my business but if you need help in something in my domain in Python (with Pandas, Numpy, fastApi etc) or React, then don't hesitate to get in touch.

All the best,


Giles
