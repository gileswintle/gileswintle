Hi,

I work in the real estate fund management industry, basied in France but overseaing a European business.

I use Python, usually with Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn etc for modelling investment returns and general automation, often with web apps in Fast Api or Flask.

A few things I have found useful are up here, please use as you see fit.
